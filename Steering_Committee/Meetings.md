*January 29,2025*

The Steering Committee approved a Bug Bounty Program budget with award ammounts for Small, Medium, and Largebugs. The program will run for 6 months The proposal will go to the GB for approval on 1/30 and legal reviiew after that. If the program is successful, the investment will increase over time. 

Nathan Schloss from Meta volunteered as the first Steering Committee Chair. 

The team decided to use Github as the program's webpage for now and focus on the Bug Bounty Program instead of flaky testing. 

Action items include refining the program document for legal review, redirecting the SOCBB.org domain to the LF page, and Nathan seeking Meta's legal approval for his chair role in 2025.
